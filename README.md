# Map_Projection_Transformation

This is for my first assignment for the Course Cartography at Peking University under the supervision of Prof. Mei Li.

The code notebook elaborates on the computational methods for three types of projection transformations: the normal conformal cylindrical projection (Mercator Projection), the normal conformal tangency conic projection, and the normal conformal secant conic projection. For the latter two projections, the code also includes the calculation process for intermediary parameters. The code was written entirely in Python with interpretions written in Chinese, however, you can get their meanings easily by the code.
